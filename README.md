# Release Notes

## ✨ Digital Feeder 1.1.0 
07.12.2020


### **Attention**

Due to the new **Equipment** feature, **Stop** button does not work properly again, it's always a headache. Therefore it's **temporarily** disabled in this version.

### New features

- **Equipment**: **Static** und **kinematic** objects can be now added into a new/existing equipment.

- **Equipment library**: An equipment in the current scenario can be added into the equipment library. The equipments in the library can be loaded into the current scenario.

### Known issues

- Equipments in **equipment library** with the SAME NAME can cause chaos. So it's recommanded to rename an equipment before adding it into library.
- One equipment can only be added into the library ONCE.
- Equipment cannot be rotated.

### Features in todo

- Solve above issues.
- Preview in Equipment Library window.
- Rename equipment in Equipment Library.
- Drag a component out of the equipment, which it belongs.

### Improvements

- Replaced GPL-licensed library `tarlib` with BSD-licensed library `libarchive`, which is also more powerful and stable.
- Removed GPL-licensed library `qcustomplot` and its related feature `Plot Motion`.


## ✨ Digital Feeder 1.0.4
23.10.2020

### New features

- Margin setting.
- Higher simulation step precision (it can be set to 0.1 ms now).

### Improvements

- Expanded the range of vibration values to 999 mm.
- Added License information.


### Bug fixes
- Visibility status was not saved into scenario file.
- When a scenraio file is loaded serveral times, objects and sources share the same id.

## ✨ Digital Feeder 1.0.0
22.09.2020

### **Attention**

Due to the new **transformation** function, this version may have problems loading the `dfs` file generated by the previous versions. Therefore, you may need to use this version to recreate a `dfs` file for a corresponding scene.


### New features

- **Search bar**: search objects and sources by name (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>).

- Transformation: when importing an `stl` file, user can choose to import it as a tooling or feeding part:
	- As tooling: the object can only be set to static or kinemaic,
	- As feeding part: origin of the coordinate system of the object will be moved to the center of mass.
- Source Properties: source can be parameterized now.
- Remove source, at the same time all child objects of the source will be removed as well.
- Move and rotate source from manipulator.




### Improvements

- Highlight selected source.
- Save button on tool bar.
- By source generated objects are named with number.
- Source is shown as bold and yellow in tree view, to make it more obvious.



## ✨ 02.09.2020 (incomplete version)

### New features

- 3D-window picker: selection of objects and sources from 3D-window (holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> for multiselection).
- Tree view: the objects generated from one source will be shown in a group.
- Content menu for selected objects and/or sources from tree view and 3D-window.
- **Source Properties** Dialog: the paramters of source can be shown here, and source can be also paused and restarted.
- Normal distribution for restitution and friction.
- Hide/unhide objects and sources.

### Improvements

- Adjusted icon for **Create Source** button.
- Better structure of the entire codebase.

### Incomplete features

This version is incomplete. The following features are still under heavy construction and will be done in next releases:

- **Stop** button: it does not work properly (again).
- Source is still not parameterizable from **Source Properties**.
- Source cannot be removed.
- Selected source still cannot be highlighted in 3D-window.
- By clicking on **Properties** button: 
	- when only objects are selected, the **Object Properties** dialog shows;
	- when only sources are selected, the **Source Properties** dialog shows;
	- But when both objects and sources are selected, also only the **Object Properties** dialog shows, which is wrong. (In the next release, a dialog will be shown at first, to let user choose which dialog window to be shown.)


## ✨ 19.07.2020

###  Improvements

- Greater camera far plane to render the objects far away from camera.

### Bug fixes

- Failure when setting color of sevaral objects parallelly.
- Failure when turning object from static to kinematic.

## ✨ 07.07.2020

### New features

- Set static object **immaterial**, in oder to remove its rigid body from simulation.
- New file format `.dfs` (*Digital Feeder Scenario*).
- Drag & Drop `.stl` and `.dfs` files.
- Open `.dfs` file directly with Digital Feeder.
- Multi parameterization.

### Bug fixes

- Crash when loading ASCII `stl` file.

## ✨ 16.06.2020

### New features:

- Shortcut: double click middle button on object: Move camera to current selected object and set it as the camera focus center.
- Motion flag (Dynamic/Static/Kinematic) for each object shown in object list.
- Stop simulation: before the first run of the simulation, the scenario will be saved as the start scenario. When clicking the stop button, the scenario will be reset to the start scenario:

###  Improvements

- Import several `stl`-files at the same time. The selection count is shown in status bar.
- Rename the imported `stl` objects with their file name automatically.
- Object multiselection und deselection.
- Optimized the behavior of button state switching (enabled/disabled).
- After simulation paused/stopped, the object position and angle will be updated in the manipulator.
- Warning when create more than one source at the same time.
- The objects, which are cloned from the same part source, share the same bullet collision shape.


### Bug fixes

- Manipulator behavior.
- Stop button behavior.
